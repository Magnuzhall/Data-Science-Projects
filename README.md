# data-science-projects
This repository includes different data science projects I have worked on using machine learning.

I have been working obsessively on different data science projects, which use Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit Learn.

Please feel free to check out some of the projects.

As I learn new concepts and work on new projects I will be adding them here.

Thank you for reading.
